Webacula terminal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Webacula provides an ajax interface to Bacula Console (bconsole) - Webacula
terminal.

Important to understand that you need to write commands to 'bconsole' in the CLI
style. Webacula terminal is not fully interactive.

For example, you do not have to write in terminal:
    status

correctly write so:
    status all

or:
   status dir
   status storage="storage.file.1"

an so on.



See Bacula documentation "Running the Console from a Shell Script" chapter for
details.

IMPORTANT! The Bacula Console have a flexible ACLs (Access Control Lists).
    See Bacula documentation "The Console Resource" chapter for details.
